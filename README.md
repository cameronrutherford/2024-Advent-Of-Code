# Advent of Code

Advent of code is a yearly tradition hosted [here](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repo will contain my work / solutions. Perhaps I will re-publish on my website.

## Requirements

In order to start using this repo, you need:

- C++ installed locally
- Make installed locally
- dos2unix insatlled locally
- cppcheck installed locally

Maybe I will do some more complicated packaging in future, but this will
keep me to using minimal external libraries, and sticking to the C++ STL.

## Notes

Since this is something that I am doing for my teaching of CISC2200 Data
Structures at Fordham, I will be programming in C++.

In future years I may consider using this as an opportunity to try a new
language / editor.

Since I am already competent at C++, I will try to write as few lines /
characters as possible within reason, focusing on concise (not readable) code.

## Structure

There will be a folder for each day's code. `main.cpp` should solve the problem.
